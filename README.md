# ML_project
This project uses machine learning algorithm to predict the type of star. 
Initially the dataset is pre-processesed, this is the most important phase of for this project. After cleaning and processing the data, next we apply various Machine learning algorithms. We visualize the results of all the algorithms and consider the algorithm that scores the highest of all. We split the data into training set and testing set and train and test the data respectively. 
Next, we take input from the user, and predict the correct output of the type of the star.
Thank You.
